<p> \page  osissues        Operating System Issues
</p>
<p>This appendix describes the operating system specific interfaces in FLTK:
\li \ref osissues_accessing<br/>
\li \ref osissues_unix<br/>
\li \ref osissues_win32<br/>
\li \ref osissues_macos
</p>
<p>\section osissues_accessing Accessing the OS Interfaces
</p>
<p>All programs that need to access the operating system
specific interfaces must include the following header file:
</p>
<p>\code<br/>
#include &lt;FL/x.H&gt;<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>Despite the name, this header file will define the
appropriate interface for your environment. The pages that
follow describe the functionality that is provided for each
operating system.
</p>
<p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="0" BGCOLOR="#cccccc"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
</p><p>        &lt;TD&gt;&lt;B&gt;WARNING:&lt;/B&gt;
</p>
<pre>
        The interfaces provided by this header file may
        change radically in new FLTK releases. Use them only
        when an existing generic FLTK interface is not
        sufficient.

        &lt;/TD&gt;
</pre>
<p>&lt;/TR&gt;<br/>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br/>
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
</p>
<p>\section osissues_unix The UNIX (X11) Interface
</p>
<p>The UNIX interface provides access to the X Window System
state information and data structures.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues<u>x</u>events Handling Other X Events
</p>
<p>void Fl::add_handler(int (*f)(int))
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Installs a function to parse unrecognized events. If FLTK
cannot figure out what to do with an event, it calls each of
these functions (most recent first) until one of them returns
non-zero. If none of them returns non-zero then the event is
ignored.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
FLTK calls this for any X events it does not recognize, or X
events with a window ID that FLTK does not recognize. You can
look at the X event in the \c fl_xevent variable.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
The argument is the FLTK event type that was not handled, or
zero for unrecognized X events. These handlers are also called
for global shortcuts and some other events that the widget they
were passed to did not handle, for example
\c FL_SHORTCUT.
</p>
<p>extern XEvent *fl_xevent
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This variable contains the most recent X event.
</p>
<p>extern ulong fl_event_time
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This variable contains the time stamp from the most recent X
event that reported it; not all events do. Many X calls like cut
and paste need this value.
</p>
<p>Window fl_xid(const Fl_Window *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the XID for a window, or zero if not \c shown().
</p>
<p>Fl_Window *fl_find(ulong xid)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the Fl_Window that corresponds to the given
XID, or \c NULL if not found. This function uses a cache
so it is slightly faster than iterating through the windows
yourself.
</p>
<p>int fl_handle(const XEvent &amp;)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This call allows you to supply the X events to FLTK, which
may allow FLTK to cooperate with another toolkit or library. The
return value is non-zero if FLTK understood the event. If the
window does not belong to FLTK and the \c add_handler()
functions all return 0, this function will return false.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Besides feeding events your code should call Fl::flush()
periodically so that FLTK redraws its windows.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This function will call the callback functions. It will not
return until they complete. In particular, if a callback pops up
a modal window by calling<br/>
fl_ask(),<br/>
for instance, it will not return until the modal function
returns.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_drawing_xlib Drawing using Xlib
</p>
<p>The following global variables are set before
Fl_Widget::draw() is called, or by Fl_Window::make_current():
</p>
<p>\code<br/>
extern Display *fl_display;<br/>
extern Window fl_window;<br/>
extern GC fl_gc;<br/>
extern int fl_screen;<br/>
extern XVisualInfo *fl_visual;<br/>
extern Colormap fl_colormap;<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>You must use them to produce Xlib calls.  Don't attempt to change
them. A typical X drawing call is written like this:
</p>
<p>\code<br/>
XDrawSomething(fl_display, fl_window, fl_gc, ...);
\endcode
</p>
<p>Other information such as the position or size of the X
window can be found by looking at Fl_Window::current(),
which returns a pointer to the Fl_Window being drawn.
</p>
<p>unsigned long fl_xpixel(Fl_Color i) &lt;br&gt;
unsigned long fl_xpixel(uchar r, uchar g, uchar b)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the X pixel number used to draw the given FLTK color
index or RGB color. This is the X pixel that
\ref drawing_colors "fl_color()"<br/>
would use.
</p>
<p>int fl_parse_color(const char* p, uchar&amp; r, uchar&amp; g, uchar&amp; b)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Convert a name into the red, green, and blue values of a color
by parsing the X11 color names. On other systems, \c fl_parse_color()
can only convert names in hexadecimal encoding, for example &lt;tt&gt;\#ff8083&lt;/tt&gt;.
 
</p><p>extern XFontStruct *fl_xfont
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Points to the font selected by the most recent
\ref ssect_Fonts "fl_font()".<br/>
This is not necessarily the current font of \c fl_gc,
which is not set until<br/>
\ref ssect_Text "fl_draw()"<br/>
is called. If FLTK was compiled with Xft support, \c fl_xfont
will usually be 0 and \c fl_xftfont will contain a pointer 
to the \c XftFont structure instead.
</p>
<p>extern void *fl_xftfont
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
If FLTK was compiled with Xft support enabled, \c fl_xftfont
points to the xft font selected by the most recent
\ref ssect_Fonts "fl_font()".<br/>
Otherwise it will be 0. \c fl_xftfont should be cast to 
&lt;tt&gt;XftFont*&lt;/tt&gt;.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_xvisual Changing the Display, Screen, or X Visual
</p>
<p>FLTK uses only a single display, screen, X visual, and X
colormap. This greatly simplifies its internal structure and
makes it much smaller and faster. You can change which it uses
by setting global variables<br/>
&lt;I&gt;<br/>
before the first Fl_Window::show() is called.
&lt;/I&gt;<br/>
You may also want to call Fl::visual(), which is a portable interface
to get a full color and/or double buffered visual.
</p>
<p>int Fl::display(const char *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Set which X display to use.  This actually does
&lt;tt&gt;putenv("DISPLAY=...")&lt;/tt&gt; so that child programs
will display on the same screen if called with \c exec().
This must be done before the display is opened. This call is
provided under MacOS and WIN32 but it has no effect.
</p>
<p>extern Display *fl_display
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
The open X display. This is needed as an argument to most
Xlib calls. Don't attempt to change it! This is \c NULL
before the display is opened.
</p>
<p>void fl_open_display()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Opens the display. Does nothing if it is already open. This
will make sure \c fl_display is non-zero. You should call
this if you wish to do X calls and there is a chance that your
code will be called before the first \c show() of a window.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This may call Fl::abort() if there is an error opening the display.
</p>
<p>void fl_close_display()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This closes the X connection. You do \e not need to call
this to exit, and in fact it is faster to not do so! It may be
useful to call this if you want your program to continue without
the X connection. You cannot open the display again, and
probably cannot call any FLTK functions.
</p>
<p>extern int fl_screen
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Which screen number to use. This is set by
\c fl_open_display() to the default screen. You can change
it by setting this to a different value immediately afterwards.
It can also be set by changing the last number in the
Fl::display() string to "host:0.#".
</p>
<p>extern XVisualInfo *fl_visual &lt;br&gt;<br/>
extern Colormap fl_colormap
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
The visual and colormap that FLTK will use for all windows.
These are set by \c fl_open_display() to the default
visual and colormap. You can change them before calling
\c show() on the first window. Typical code for changing
the default visual is:<br/>
\code<br/>
Fl::args(argc, argv); // do this first so $DISPLAY is set
fl_open_display();<br/>
fl_visual = find<u>a</u>good_visual(fl_display, fl_screen);
if (!fl_visual) Fl::abort("No good visual");
fl_colormap = make<u>a</u>colormap(fl_display, fl_visual-&gt;visual, fl_visual-&gt;depth);
// it is now ok to show() windows:<br/>
window-&gt;show(argc, argv);<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_specialx Using a Subclass of Fl_Window for Special X Stuff
</p>
<p>FLTK can manage an X window on a different screen, visual
and/or colormap, you just can't use FLTK's drawing routines to
draw into it. But you can write your own \c draw() method
that uses Xlib (and/or OpenGL) calls only.
</p>
<p>FLTK can also manage XID's provided by other libraries or
programs, and call those libraries when the window needs to be
redrawn.
</p>
<p>To do this, you need to make a subclass of
Fl_Window<br/>
and override some of these virtual functions:
</p>
<p>virtual void Fl_Window::show()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
If the window is already \c shown() this must cause it
to be raised, this can usually be done by calling Fl_Window::show().
If not \c shown() your implementation must call either
Fl_X::set_xid() or Fl_X::make_xid().
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
An example:<br/>
\code<br/>
void MyWindow::show() {<br/>
  if (shown()) {Fl_Window::show(); return;}  // you must do this!
  fl_open_display();    // necessary if this is first window
  // we only calculate the necessary visual colormap once:
  static XVisualInfo *visual;<br/>
  static Colormap colormap;<br/>
  if (!visual) {<br/>
    visual = figure_out_visual();<br/>
    colormap = XCreateColormap(fl_display, RootWindow(fl_display,fl_screen),
</p><p>                               vis-&gt;visual, AllocNone);
  }<br/>
  Fl_X::make_xid(this, visual, colormap);
}<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>\verbatim<br/>
Fl_X <em>Fl_X::set_xid(Fl_Window</em>, Window xid)
\endverbatim
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Allocate a hidden class called an Fl_X, put the
XID into it, and set a pointer to it from the Fl_Window.
This causes Fl_Window::shown() to return true.
</p>
<p>void Fl_X::make_xid(Fl_Window<em>, XVisualInfo</em> = fl_visual, Colormap = fl_colormap)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This static method does the most onerous parts of creating an
X window, including setting the label, resize limitations, etc.
It then does Fl_X::set_xid() with this new window and maps the window.
</p>
<p>virtual void Fl_Window::flush()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This virtual function is called by Fl::flush() to
update the window. For FLTK's own windows it does this by
setting the global variables \c fl_window and \c fl_gc
and then calling the \c draw() method.  For
your own windows you might just want to put all the drawing code
in here.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
The X region that is a combination of all \c damage()
calls done so far is in &lt;tt&gt;Fl_X::i(this)-&gt;region&lt;/tt&gt;. If
\c NULL then you should redraw the entire window. The
undocumented function \c fl_clip_region(XRegion) will
initialize the FLTK clip stack with a region or \c NULL
for no clipping. You must set region to \c NULL afterwards
as \c fl_clip_region() will own and delete it when
done.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
If &lt;tt&gt;damage() &amp; FL_DAMAGE_EXPOSE&lt;/tt&gt; then only X
expose events have happened. This may be useful if you have an
undamaged image (such as a backing buffer) around.
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Here is a sample where an undamaged image is kept somewhere:
\code<br/>
void MyWindow::flush() {<br/>
  fl_clip_region(Fl_X::i(this)-&gt;region);
  Fl_X::i(this)-&gt;region = 0;<br/>
  if (damage() != 2) {... draw things into backing store ...}
  ... copy backing store to window ...<br/>
}<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>virtual void Fl_Window::hide()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Destroy the window server copy of the window. Usually you
will destroy contexts, pixmaps, or other resources used by the
window, and then call Fl_Window::hide() to get rid of
the main window identified by \c xid(). If you override
this, you must also override the destructor as shown:
\code<br/>
void MyWindow::hide() {<br/>
  if (mypixmap) {<br/>
    XFreePixmap(fl_display,mypixmap);<br/>
    mypixmap = 0;<br/>
  }<br/>
  Fl_Window::hide(); // you must call this
}<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>virtual void Fl_Window::~Fl_Window()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Because of the way C++ works, if you override \c hide()
you \e must override the destructor as well (otherwise only
the base class \c hide() is called):<br/>
\code<br/>
MyWindow::~MyWindow() {<br/>
  hide();<br/>
}<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>\note Access to the Fl_X hidden class requires to \#define FL_INTERNALS
before compilation.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues<u>x</u>icon Setting the Icon of a Window
</p>
<p>FLTK currently supports setting a window's icon \b before it
is shown using the Fl_Window::icon() method.
</p>
<p>void Fl_Window::icon(const void *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Sets the icon for the window to the passed pointer. You will
need to cast the icon \c Pixmap to a \c char* when
calling this method. To set a monochrome icon using a bitmap compiled
with your application use:<br/>
\code<br/>
#include "icon.xbm"
</p>
<p>fl_open_display(); // needed if display has not been previously opened
</p>
<p>Pixmap p = XCreateBitmapFromData(fl_display, DefaultRootWindow(fl_display),
</p><p>                                 icon_bits, icon_width, icon_height);
</p>
<p>window-&gt;icon((const void*)p);<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
To use a multi-colored icon, the XPM format and library
should be used as follows:<br/>
\code<br/>
#include &lt;X11/xpm.h&gt;<br/>
#include "icon.xpm"
</p>
<p>fl_open_display();                // needed if display has not been previously opened
</p>
<p>Pixmap p, mask;
</p>
<p>XpmCreatePixmapFromData(fl_display, DefaultRootWindow(fl_display),
</p><p>                                 icon_xpm, &amp;p, &amp;mask, NULL);
</p>
<p>window-&gt;icon((const void *)p);<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
When using the Xpm library, be sure to include it in the list
of libraries that are used to link the application (usually "-lXpm").
</p>
<p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="0" BGCOLOR="#cccccc"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
</p><p>        &lt;TD&gt;&lt;B&gt;NOTE:&lt;/B&gt;
        
</p><pre>
        You must call Fl_Window::show(int argc, char** argv)
        for the icon to be used. The Fl_Window::show() method
        does not bind the icon to the window.

        &lt;/TD&gt;
</pre>
<p>&lt;/TR&gt;<br/>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br/>
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_xresources X Resources
</p>
<p>When the<br/>
Fl_Window::show(int argc, char** argv)<br/>
method is called, FLTK looks for the following X resources:
</p>
<p>\li \c background - The default background color
</p><p>        for widgets (color).
</p>
<p>\li \c dndTextOps - The default setting for
</p><p>        drag and drop text operations (boolean).
</p>
<p>\li \c foreground - The default foreground (label)
</p><p>        color for widgets (color).
</p>
<p>\li \c scheme - The default scheme to use (string).
</p>
<p>\li \c selectBackground - The default selection
</p><p>        color for menus, etc. (color).
</p>
<p>\li &lt;tt&gt;Text.background&lt;/tt&gt; - The default background
</p><p>        color for text fields (color).
</p>
<p>\li \c tooltips - The default setting for
</p><p>        tooltips (boolean).
</p>
<p>\li \c visibleFocus - The default setting for
</p><p>        visible keyboard focus on non-text widgets (boolean).
</p>
<p>Resources associated with the first window's Fl_Window::xclass()
string are queried first, or if no class has been specified then
the class "fltk" is used (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;fltk.background&lt;/tt&gt;). If no
match is found, a global search is done (e.g.
&lt;tt&gt;*background&lt;/tt&gt;).
</p>
<p>\section osissues_win32 The Windows (WIN32) Interface
</p>
<p>The Windows interface provides access to the WIN32 GDI
state information and data structures.
</p>
<p>\subsection non_ascii_filenames Using filenames with non-ASCII characters
</p>
<p>In FLTK, all strings, including filenames, are UTF-8 encoded. The utility functions
fl_fopen() and fl_open() allow to open files potentially having non-ASCII names in a 
cross-platform fashion, whereas the standard fopen()/open() functions fail to do so.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_wm_quit Responding to WM_QUIT
</p>
<p>FLTK will intercept WM_QUIT messages that are directed towards the
thread that runs the main loop. These are converted to SIGTERM signals
via \c raise(). This allows you to deal with outside termination
requests with the same code on both Windows and UNIX systems.
Other processes can send this message via \c PostThreadMessage() in
order to request, rather than force your application to terminate.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_win32_messages Handling Other WIN32 Messages
</p>
<p>By default a single WNDCLASSEX called "FLTK" is
created. All Fl_Window 's are of this class unless you
use Fl_Window::xclass(). The window class is created
the first time Fl_Window::show() is called.
</p>
<p>You can probably combine FLTK with other libraries that make
their own WIN32 window classes. The easiest way is to call
Fl::wait(), as it will call \c DispatchMessage()
for all messages to the other windows. If necessary you can let
the other library take over as long as it calls
\c DispatchMessage(), but you will have to arrange for the
function Fl::flush() to be called regularly so that
widgets are updated, timeouts are handled, and the idle
functions are called.
</p>
<p>extern MSG fl_msg
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
This variable contains the most recent message read by
\c GetMessage(), which is called by Fl::wait().
This may not be the<br/>
most recent message sent to an FLTK window, because silly WIN32
calls the handle procedures directly for some events (sigh).
</p>
<p>void Fl::add_handler(int (*f)(int))
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Installs a function to parse unrecognized messages sent to
FLTK windows. If FLTK cannot figure out what to do with a
message, it calls each of these functions (most recent first)
until one of them returns non-zero. The argument passed to the
functions is the FLTK event that was not handled or zero for
unknown messages. If all the handlers return zero then FLTK
calls \c DefWindowProc().
</p>
<p>HWND fl_xid(const Fl_Window *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the window handle for a Fl_Window, or zero
if not \c shown().
</p>
<p>Fl_Window *fl_find(HWND xid)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the Fl_Window that corresponds to the given
window handle, or \c NULL if not found. This function uses
a cache so it is slightly faster than iterating through the
windows yourself.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_win32_gdi Drawing Things Using the WIN32 GDI
</p>
<p>When the virtual function Fl_Widget::draw() is
called, FLTK stores all the extra arguments you need to
make a proper GDI call in some global variables:
</p>
<p>\code<br/>
extern HINSTANCE fl_display;<br/>
extern HWND fl_window;<br/>
extern HDC fl_gc;<br/>
COLORREF fl_RGB();<br/>
HPEN fl_pen();<br/>
HBRUSH fl_brush();<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>These global variables are set before Fl_Widget::draw() is called, or by
Fl_Window::make_current().<br/>
You can refer to them when needed to produce GDI calls, but don't
attempt to change them. The functions return GDI objects for
the current color set by<br/>
\ref drawing_colors "fl_color()"<br/>
and are created as<br/>
needed and cached. A typical GDI drawing call is written like
this:
</p>
<p>\code<br/>
DrawSomething(fl_gc, ..., fl_brush());<br/>
\endcode
</p>
<p>It may also be useful to refer to Fl_Window::current()
to get the window's size or position.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_icon_windows Setting the Icon of a Window
</p>
<p>FLTK currently supports setting a window's icon <em>before</em> it
is shown using the Fl_Window::icon() method.
</p>
<p>void Fl_Window::icon(const void *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Sets the icon for the window to the passed pointer. You will
need to cast the \c HICON handle to a \c char* when
calling this method. To set the icon using an icon resource
compiled with your application use:<br/>
\code<br/>
window-&gt;icon((const void *)LoadIcon(fl_display, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDI_ICON)));
\endcode
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
You can also use the \c LoadImage() and related
functions to load specific resolutions or create the icon from
bitmap data.
</p>
<p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;TABLE WIDTH="90%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="0" BGCOLOR="#cccccc"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
</p><p>        &lt;TD&gt;&lt;B&gt;NOTE:&lt;/B&gt;
        
</p><pre>
        You must call Fl_Window::show(int argc, char** argv)
        for the icon to be used. The Fl_Window::show() method
        does not bind the icon to the window.

        &lt;/TD&gt;
</pre>
<p>&lt;/TR&gt;<br/>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br/>
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_msdos_console How to Not Get a MSDOS Console Window
</p>
<p>WIN32 has a really stupid mode switch stored in the
executables that controls whether or not to make a console
window.
</p>
<p>To always get a console window you simply create a console
application (the "/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE" option for the
linker). For a GUI-only application create a WIN32 application
(the "/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS" option for the linker).
</p>
<p>FLTK includes a \c WinMain() function that calls the
ANSI standard \c main() entry point for you.
&lt;I&gt;<br/>
This function creates a console window when you use the debug
version of the library.<br/>
&lt;/I&gt;
</p>
<p>WIN32 applications without a console cannot write to
\c stdout or \c stderr, even if they are run from a
console window. Any output is silently thrown away.
Additionally, WIN32 applications are run in the background by
the console, although you can use "start /wait program" to run
them in the foreground.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_win32_problems Known WIN32 Bugs and Problems
</p>
<p>The following is a list of known bugs and problems in the WIN32
version of FLTK:
</p>
<pre>
\li     If a program is deactivated, &lt;tt&gt;Fl::wait()&lt;/tt&gt;
        does not return until it is activated again, even though
        many events are delivered to the program. This can cause
        idle background processes to stop unexpectedly. This
        also happens while the user is dragging or resizing
        windows or otherwise holding the mouse down. We were
        forced to remove most of the efficiency FLTK uses for
        redrawing in order to get windows to update while being
        moved. This is a design error in WIN32 and probably
        impossible to get around.

\li     &lt;tt&gt;Fl_Gl_Window::can_do_overlay()&lt;/tt&gt; returns true
        until the first time it attempts to draw an overlay, and
        then correctly returns whether or not there is overlay
        hardware.

\li     &lt;tt&gt;SetCapture&lt;/tt&gt; (used by &lt;tt&gt;Fl::grab()&lt;/tt&gt;)
        doesn't work, and the main window title bar turns gray
        while menus are popped up.

\li     Compilation with &lt;tt&gt;gcc 3.4.4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-Os&lt;/tt&gt; exposes an
        optimisation bug in gcc. The symptom is that when drawing
        filled circles only the perimeter is drawn. This can for instance
        be seen in the symbols demo. Other optimisation options such
        as -O2 and -O3 seem to work OK. More details can be found
        in STR#1656

<p>\section osissues_macos The Apple OS X Interface
</p>
<p>FLTK supports Apple OS X using the Apple Cocoa library. Older
versions of MacOS are no longer supported.
</p>
<p>Control, Option, and Command Modifier Keys
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
FLTK maps the Mac 'control' key to \c FL_CTRL, the
'option' key to \c FL_ALT and the 'Apple' key to
\c FL_META. Furthermore, \c FL_COMMAND designates the 'Apple' key on Mac OS X
and the 'control' key on other platforms.
Keyboard events return the key name in<br/>
Fl::event_key() and the keystroke translation in
Fl::event_text(). For example, typing Option-Y on a Mac
US keyboard will set \c FL_ALT in Fl::event_state(),
set Fl::event_key() to 'y' and return the Yen symbol in
Fl::event_text().
</p>
<p>Right Click simulation with Ctrl Click<br/>
\par<br/>
The Apple HIG guidelines indicate applications should support
'Ctrl Click' to simulate 'Right Click' for e.g. context menus,
so users with one-button mice and one-click trackpads can still
access right-click features. However, paraphrasing 
&lt;A HREF="<a href="http://www.fltk.org/newsgroups.php?gfltk.coredev+v:14725">http://www.fltk.org/newsgroups.php?gfltk.coredev+v:14725</a>"&gt;
Manolo's comment on the fltk.coredev newsgroup&lt;/A&gt;:
\par<br/>
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;
</p><p>    &lt;I&gt;FLTK does /not/ support Ctrl-Click == Right Click itself because Mac OS
    X event processing doesn't support this at the system level: the system
    reports left-clicks with the ctrl modifier when the user ctrl-clicks, and
    OS X system preferences don't allow changing this behavior. Therefore,
    applications must handle simulation of Right Click with Ctrl Click
    in the application code.&lt;/I&gt;<br/>
&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;<br/>
\par<br/>
Ian MacArthur provided the following handle() method code snippet
showing an example of how to do this:<br/>
\code
</p><p>    case FL_PUSH:<br/>
    {
</p><p>        int btn = Fl::event_button();<br/>
#ifdef __APPLE__
</p><p>        int ev_state = Fl::event_state();
#endif
</p><pre>
        //
        // Context menu can be called up in one of two ways: -
        //     1 - right click, as normally used on Windows and Linux
        //     2 - Ctrl + left click, as sometimes used on Mac
        //
#ifdef __APPLE__
        // On apple, check right click, and ctrl+left click
        if ((btn == FL_RIGHT_MOUSE) || (ev_state == (FL_CTRL | FL_BUTTON1)))
#else
        // On other platforms, only check right click as ctrl+left is used for selections
        if (btn == FL_RIGHT_MOUSE)
#endif
        {
            // Did we right click on the object?..
</pre>
<p>\endcode<br/>
\par<br/>
There is a thread about this subject on fltk.coredev (Aug 1-14, 2014)
entitled "[RFC] Right click emulation for one button mouse on Mac".
</p>
<p>Apple "Quit" Event
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
When the user presses Cmd-Q or requests a termination of the
application, OS X will send a "Quit" Apple Event. FLTK handles
this event by sending an \c FL_CLOSE event to all open
windows. If all windows close, the application will terminate.
</p>
<p>Apple "Open" Event
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Whenever the user drops a file onto an application icon, OS X
generates an Apple Event of the type "Open". You can have FLTK
notify you of an Open event by calling the \ref fl_open_callback 
function.
</p>
<p>void fl_open_display()
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Opens the display. Does nothing if it is already open. You should call
this if you wish to do Cocoa or Quartz calls and there is a chance that your
code will be called before the first \c show() of a window.
</p>
<p>Window fl_xid(const Fl_Window *)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the window reference for an Fl_Window, or
\c NULL if the window has not been shown. This reference is a pointer
to an instance of the subclass FLWindow of Cocoa's NSWindow class.
</p>
<p>Fl_Window *fl_find(Window xid)
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Returns the Fl_Window that corresponds to the given window reference,
or \c NULL if not found.
</p>
<p>void fl_mac_set_about( Fl_Callback *cb, void *user_data, int shortcut) 
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
Attaches the callback \c cb to the "About myprog" item of the system application menu.
\c cb will be called with NULL first argument and \c user_data second argument.
</p>
<p>Fl_Sys_Menu_Bar class
</p>
<p>\par<br/>
The Fl_Sys_Menu_Bar class allows to build menu bars that, on Mac OS X, are
placed in the system menu bar (at top-left of display), and, on other platforms,
at a user-chosen location of a user-chosen window.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_icon_osx Setting the icon of an application
\li First, create a .icns file containing several copies of your icon of decreasing sizes.
This can be done using the Preview application or the Icon Composer application
available in "Graphics Tools for Xcode". To create a high resolution icon file,
it is necessary to use the iconutil command-line utility.
\li Put your .icns file in the Resources subdirectory of your application bundle.
\li Add these two lines to the Info.plist file of your application bundle
\verbatim<br/>
&lt;key&gt;CFBundleIconFile&lt;/key&gt;<br/>
&lt;string&gt;foo.icns&lt;/string&gt;<br/>
\endverbatim<br/>
replacing &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; by your application name. If you use Xcode, just add your .icns file to your 
application target.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_quartz Drawing Things Using Quartz
All code inside Fl_Widget::draw()<br/>
is expected to call Quartz drawing functions. The Quartz coordinate system 
is flipped to match<br/>
FLTK's coordinate system. The origin for all drawing is in the top
left corner of the enclosing Fl_Window. The global variable
\c fl_gc (of type \c CGContextRef) is the appropriate Quartz 2D drawing environment.
Include FL/x.H to declare the \c fl_gc variable.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_localize Internationalization
All FLTK programs contain an application menu with, e.g., the About xxx, Hide xxx, and Quit xxx items.
This menu can be internationalized/localized by any of two means.
\li using the Fl_Mac_App_Menu class.<br/>
\li using the standard Mac OS X localization procedure. Create a language-specific .lproj directory 
(e.g., &lt;tt&gt;German.lproj&lt;/tt&gt;) in the Resources subdirectory of the application bundle. 
Create therein a &lt;tt&gt;Localizable.strings&lt;/tt&gt; file that translates all menu items to this language. 
The German &lt;tt&gt;Localizable.strings&lt;/tt&gt; file, for example, contains:
\verbatim<br/>
"About %@" = "&Atilde;œber %@";<br/>
"Print Front Window"="Frontfenster drucken";
"Services" = "Dienste";<br/>
"Hide %@"="%@ ausblenden";<br/>
"Hide Others"="Andere ausblenden";<br/>
"Show All"="Alle einblenden";<br/>
"Quit %@"="%@ beenden";<br/>
\endverbatim<br/>
Set &lt;tt&gt;"Print Front Window" = "";&lt;/tt&gt; therein so the application menu doesn't show a "Print Front Window" item.
To localize the application name itself, create a file &lt;tt&gt;InfoPlist.strings&lt;/tt&gt; in each .lproj directory
and put &lt;tt&gt;CFBundleName = "localized name";&lt;/tt&gt; in each such file.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_retina OpenGL and 'retina' displays
It is possible to have OpenGL produce graphics at the high pixel resolution allowed by the so-called 'retina' displays
present on recent Apple hardware.<br/>
For this, call <br/>
\verbatim<br/>
Fl::use_high_res_GL(1); <br/>
\endverbatim<br/>
before any Fl_Gl_Window is shown. Also, adapt your Fl_Gl_Window::draw() and Fl_Gl_Window::draw_overlay() methods replacing
\verbatim<br/>
glViewport(0, 0, w(), h());<br/>
\endverbatim<br/>
by<br/>
\verbatim<br/>
glViewport(0, 0, pixel_w(), pixel_h());
\endverbatim<br/>
making use of the Fl_Gl_Window::pixel_w() and Fl_Gl_Window::pixel_h() methods that return the width and height of
the GL scene in pixels: if the Fl_Gl_Window is mapped on a retina display, these methods return twice as much as
reported by Fl_Widget::w() and Fl_Widget::h(); if it's mapped on a regular display, they return the same values
as w() and h(). These methods dynamically change their values if the window is moved into/out from a retina
display. If Fl::use_high_res_GL(1) is not called, all Fl_Gl_Window 's are drawn at low resolution.
These methods are synonyms of w() and h() on non-Mac OS X platforms, so the source code remains cross-platform.
</p>
<p>The Fl_Gl_Window::pixels_per_unit() method is useful when the OpenGL code depends on the pixel dimension
of the GL scene. This occurs, e.g., if a window's handle() method uses Fl::event_x() and Fl::event_y()
whose returned values should be multiplied by Fl_Gl_Window::pixels_per_unit() to obtain the adequate pixel units.
This method may also be useful, for example, to adjust the width of a line in a high resolution GL scene.
</p>
<p>\subsection double_window Fl_Double_Window
</p>
<p>OS X double-buffers all windows automatically. On OS X, Fl_Window and Fl_Double_Window are handled
internally in the same way.
</p>
<p>\subsection osissues_mac_files Mac File System Specifics
</p>
<p>\par Resource Forks
</p>
<p>FLTK does not access the resource fork of an application.
However, a minimal resource fork must be created for OS X
applications. Starting with OS X 10.6, resource forks are
no longer needed.
</p>
<p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br/>
&lt;TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#cccccc" CELLPADDING="5"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;B&gt;Caution (OS X 10.2 and older):&lt;/B&gt;
</p>
<p>When using UNIX commands to copy or move executables, OS X
will NOT copy any resource forks! For copying and moving use
CpMac and MvMac respectively. For creating a tar archive, all
executables need to be stripped from their Resource Fork before
packing, e.g. "DeRez fluid &gt; fluid.r". After unpacking the
Resource Fork needs to be reattached, e.g. "Rez fluid.r -o
fluid".<br/>
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br/>
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
</p>
<p>It is advisable to use the Finder for moving and copying and
Mac archiving tools like Sit for distribution as they will
handle the Resource Fork correctly. 
</p>
<p>\par Mac File Paths
</p>
<p>FLTK uses UTF-8-encoded UNIX-style filenames and paths.
